Below is the list of baseline queries you should implement in PHP. You may implement additional queries based on the database you have created.

1. Find the names of authors who have purchased a book written by themselves. (aid and cid will not be the same).
2. User input one author name, find all the books written by the author(s).
3. User input one customer name, find purchase history of the customer(s).
4. User input one or more words of a book title, find all information of the books whose titles contain those words.
5. Design a drop down menu so user can use it to select a year and find the title of the best selling book of that year.
6. Record the information that a customr has purchased a book.
7. Add a new customer to the database.
8. User input one name and address, update the address in people, and author or customer table if applicable.
9. Add a new book to the database. If the author and/or the publisher of the new book is not in the database, insert all information about the author and/or publisher as well.
10. Delete a book. If the author of the book has not written other books, delete the author as well.

NOTE: Do not use Java Script or CSS in your html file.
