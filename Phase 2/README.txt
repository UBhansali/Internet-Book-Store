The purpose of this project is to develop PHP APIs that expose our PHP/MySQL-based 
application and allow a mobile app to query the database. This project consists of 
two components:

1) Backend (PHP, MySQL) - /backend
2) Android Application (Java) - /Android

To develop and run this application, the following components need to be installed:

1) XAMPP (Apache, PHP, MySQL)
2) Android Studio

Once these tools are installed, the application can be used on an Android emulator 
or a physical device. To run:

1) Start the XAMPP server
2) Press the green "play" button in Android Studio once the project is loaded.

The user will be welcomed with an authentication screen. The user can register and login
with an account. Once signed in, the user can open the navigation drawer on the top left
and choose a task.
